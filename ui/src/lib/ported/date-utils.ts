 * Shared UTC-only date helpers for the view renderers (calendar grid, timeline
 * lanes, timeline drag). Date construction is deliberately UTC-string-based
 * (Date.UTC + toISOString().slice(0,10)) and NEVER `new Date(year, month, day)`
 * local-time — so a grid/scale is identical regardless of the runner's or the
 * user's timezone (the calendar off-by-one-day bug class is structurally closed).
 *
 * Extracted from calendar-grid.ts / timeline-lanes.ts / timeline-view.tsx, which
 * each carried byte-identical copies (the Cluster-5 review flagged the
 * triplication). One home keeps the TZ-safety discipline from drifting per-copy.
