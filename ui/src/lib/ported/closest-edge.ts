 * The single midpoint primitive for kanban drop placement (the "closest edge"
 * pattern from Atlassian Pragmatic / react-beautiful-dnd). Given the dragged
 * card's live center-Y and the over-card's geometry, returns which EDGE of the
 * over-card the drop should attach to — the one fact dnd-kit's collision
 * (`closestCorners`) does NOT give you. Both the drop-index logic
 * (`dropSlotPosition`) and the live drop-line indicator consume this; it is the
 * sole place the midpoint comparison lives (no duplication).
 *
 * Pure: no dnd-kit import. The caller extracts `activeCenterY` from the drag
 * event's `active.rect.current.translated` and `overRect` from `over.rect`.
